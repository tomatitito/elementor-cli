1. We have a lot of end to end tests, but they don't actually test against the website that is spun up using the staging environment. I want you to refactor the tests for the `elementor-cli` subcommands `push` and `preview sync` and `preview watch` to use website from the staging environment to check if the content is pushed and changes appear on the site.

2. Also, there are open issues in github. I want you to fix them as well.

Pick the next test or issue you find most appropriate and fix it. When you are commit and push. Then output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
